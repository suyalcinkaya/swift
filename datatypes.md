# Data Types

If we do not specify it, it takes the data type from the value we assigned.

```swift
var firstName = "Onur"
```
> Data type of firstName is **_String_**

It's not necessary if we are talking about the types below. But it's nice to have if we create our own data type. (It's like TypeScript)

- String
- Int
- Float
- Double
- Bool

```swift
var aString:String = "Onur"
var anInteger:Int = 100
var aFloat:Float = 0.2
var aDouble:Double = 0.3
var aBool:Bool = true
```
